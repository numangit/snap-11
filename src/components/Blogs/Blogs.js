Securely transmits information between parties (like client-side to server-side) as a JSON object. Client logs in with username and password. Then Server creates token for client. Server sends the (Access token and Refresh token) token to the client. Client stores the token on either local storage or browser cookie. Next time the client makes a request, a copy of the (Access) token is sent to the server for authorization. Server verifies JWT signature before giving the authorization. Then Server responds to the clientâ€™s request.</Accordion.Body>
